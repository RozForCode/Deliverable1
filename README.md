# War Card Game 🎴

A **console-based** implementation of the classic **War** card game in Java. Two players compete by drawing cards, with the higher-ranked card winning the round. In case of a tie, a "war" occurs where additional cards are played to determine the winner. The game continues until one player collects all the cards.
